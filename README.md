Singers API Project 

This is a simple Express.js project created as part of my lab assignment. The project demonstrates the use of basic Node.js and Express concepts, including routing, JSON handling, and CRUD operations.

---

1. Set up a Node.js project with Express framework
   - Installed Express and Nodemon using npm.
   - Created `package.json` file.

2. Created a folder named `data`
   - Inside it, I created a JSON file (`Singers.json`) that stores information about 6 singers (name, id, releases).

3. Created three separate JavaScript files:
   - server1.js → Displays group member name using a simple GET route (`/`).
   - server2.js → Reads and displays the singers data from the JSON file using a GET route (`/Singers`).
   - server3.js → Handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using REST API routes.
     - GET → Show all singers.
     - POST → Add new singer.
     - PUT → Update singer by ID.
     - DELETE → Remove singer by ID.

4. Tested CRUD operations using Postman
   - Sent requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) and received correct responses.
